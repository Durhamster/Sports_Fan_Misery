      <p id="intro">
        Being a sports fan can be a painful experience, but some fan bases have
        it far worse than others. Are you one of them? You may think the teams
        you follow bring you misery, but what if you could know not only
        precisely how miserable they make you, but how many more (if any)
        championship/cup/trophy wins you likely see in your life?
      </p>
      <p>That's what this sets out to do, using the power of data!</p>

      <h3 class="question">"What years/seasons are included in this?"</h3>
      <hr class="sub_divider" />
      <p class="answer">
        Seasons are not added until they are finished. Some leagues are over 100
        years old, while others have only been around a few years. For an exact
        date range for each league, please see the
        <a href="sources.html">sources page</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="question">
        "I'm a fan of X team. How could you possibly measure the pain they bring
        me?"
      </h3>
      <hr class="sub_divider" />
      <p class="answer">
        It's actually quite simple. There are multiple approaches to quantifying
        all the emotions that go with being emotionally invested in a team. This
        site uses a combination of all three of these to achieve the most
        accurate results possible. These are:
      </p>
      <h4>The Calculus Method</h4>
      <p>
        The first is the classical approach known as the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"
          target="_blank"
          >Schwarzschild Radius</a
        >, named after German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild.
      </p>
      <h4>The Arithmetic Method</h4>
      <p>
        The second most common approach is to take number of championships,
        cups, trophies, finals an individual's team has brought them in their
        lifetime, and divide by the number of years they have been alive. This
        gives an average number of years between brief moments when the fan can
        say to themselves "maybe life isn't so bad".
      </p>
      <h4>The Consultant PowerPoint Method</h4>
      <p>
        The third approach is with a simple flow chart. The boxes in this chart
        vary based on the league in question, but roughly come down to the same
        methods mathematically. Typically getting these results requires a
        multi-year multi-million dollar contract with McKinsey, but luckily a
        few free ones are available online.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the flow chart for the National Football League would be
        the following:
      </p>
      <img alt="flowchart" width="500" height="600" id="flowchart" />

      <h3 class="question">"Will you be adding X league or Y competition?</h3>
      <hr class="sub_divider" />
      <p class="answer">
        At the moment the following leagues are planned to be added in future
        updates:

        </li>
        <li>F1, F2, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Leagues & Teams that will <b>NOT</b> be added in future updates (so
        please stop asking):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Leagues that are less than five years old (i.e. the Canadian Premier
          League)

        <li>Any All-Star teams</li>
        <li>The Co-Ed softball/kickball league you play in</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="question">"What about historical teams?</h3>
      <hr class="sub_divider" />
      <p class="answer">
        All franchises that have moved cities or changed names at any point are
        under their current name. The records from their previous city and/or
        name are included unless the league itself decided otherwise, for
        example the OKC Thunder did not inherit the Seattle Super Sonics
        records.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time there are no plans for adding options for historical team
        names or defunct teams. In other words, yes the creator of this site is
        aware that there are still a few grumpy

      <h3 class="question">
        "Why aren't any of the logos for the leagues or teams used here?"
      </h3>
      <hr class="sub_divider" />
      <p class="answer">
        To avoid any copyrights issues. Low-effort Microsoft Paint drawings of
        the logos were considered but that idea was shelved until more expensive
        legal counsel can be acquired. Sports leagues are serious about
        protecting their brands and the creator of this site is serious about
        not wanting to go to court over this.

      <p class="answer">
        Absolutely! Data collection and cleaning is a very time intensive
        process. Even partial data sets for any league would be helpful. If you
