# Sports Fan Misery ðŸ˜”

Being a sports fan can be a painful experience, but some fan bases have it far worse than others. Are you one of them? You may think the teams you follow bring you misery, but what if you could know not only precisely how miserable they make you, but how many more (if any) championship/cup/trophy wins you will likely see in the rest of your life?

That's what this sets out to do, using the power of data!
